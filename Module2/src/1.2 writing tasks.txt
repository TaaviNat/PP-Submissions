 1. a) Why does an arrival event need to generate a new arrival event? b) Which event should be generated by the start of the service?

a) Arrival events often trigger the scheduling of the next arrival event to model a continuous flow of entities into the system. This is common in scenarios where arrivals follow a probabilistic distribution like a Poisson process.

b)When an entity starts its service, the corresponding event generated is typically the departure event.
Departure events mark the end of service and are crucial for updating the system state and determining resource availability for the next entity.

Call Centre Simulation: Clock 16 (Events B4, B3)

- In the A-phase, the clock is advanced to 16 minutes, and the simulator jumps to the B-phase.
- Events B4 and B3 are processed in the B-phase.
  - Call X2 leaves the system, and work complete count for X is incremented by 1.
  - Call X3 enters the router queue.
- No more B-events are available, so the simulator moves to the C-phase.
- In the C-phase, events C2 and C3 are executed.
  - Call X2 is moved to the operator 1 queue, scheduled to complete at time 20 (event B6).
  - Event B5 is scheduled at time 17 (16 + 1) since call X3 is moved to the router.

 Call Centre Simulation: Clock 17 (Event B5)

- In the A-phase, the clock is advanced to 17 minutes, and the simulator jumps to the B-phase.
- Event B5 is processed in the B-phase.
  - Call X3 is transferred to the operator 2 queue.
- No more B-events are available, so the simulator moves to the C-phase.
- In the C-phase, events C1 and C3 are executed.
  - Call Y1 is moved to the router, and event B3 is scheduled at time 18 (17 + 1).
  - Event B7 is scheduled at time 23 (17 + 6) since call X3 is moved to the router.
