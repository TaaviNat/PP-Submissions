Everyday situations that could be simulated could maybe be Queuing for lunch at school, Talking to one person and then talking to another person. Maybe also you could simulate how a test will go.

Simulation would be a better option for these situations because you wouldn't have to get real people involved. the queue for some place could be so long and there could be so many people so it wouldnt be smart to use real people. for example queuing for a festival or concert it would take more work to do in real life than in simulation.

Well if you simulate for example a nuclear detonation or something very dangerous, it's ofcourse more safer to simulate these dangerous things than to do them in real life and if that nuclear test goes wrong it can pollute.
