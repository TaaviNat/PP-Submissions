1. Define the Age Distribution:

Start by collecting statistics on the age structure of students in the group. This could be in the form of age ranges (e.g., 18-22, 23-25, etc.) and their corresponding probabilities or frequencies.

Represent the Distribution:

Represent the age distribution in your program. You might use a data structure to store age ranges and their associated probabilities.

Generate Random Ages:

Use a random number generator to draw 1000 random values. These values will serve as the simulated ages.
Map Random Values to Age Ranges:

Create a cumulative distribution function (CDF) based on the probabilities. This involves calculating cumulative probabilities for each age range. This helps in efficiently mapping random values to specific age ranges.

Simulate Age Distribution:

For each random value, determine the corresponding age range based on the cumulative probabilities. This ensures that the simulated ages follow the same distribution as the actual age structure.
Output Results:

Collect the simulated age values and use them for further analysis or reporting.

2. Private Constructor:

The Singleton class typically has a private constructor, preventing external instantiation.
Static Method for Instance Access:

Instead of new, the pattern provides a static method (getInstance()) to get the single instance.
This ensures controlled instantiation and centralized access to the Singleton instance.

3. Poisson distribution, Exponential distribution
